A simple microservice architecture for an ecommerce application:

**Product Service:** 
This microservice is responsible for managing the products in the ecommerce store. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, and deleting products. It also exposes APIs for searching, filtering, and retrieving products.

**Order Service:** This microservice is responsible for managing the orders placed by customers. It provides functionalities for creating, updating, and cancelling orders. It also exposes APIs for retrieving order details and tracking order status.

**Payment Service:** This microservice is responsible for handling the payment transactions for the ecommerce store. It provides functionalities for processing payments using various payment gateways and APIs.

**User Service:** This microservice is responsible for managing the user accounts in the ecommerce store. It provides functionalities for user authentication, registration, and profile management. It also exposes APIs for retrieving user details and order history.

**Cart Service:** This microservice is responsible for managing the shopping carts for customers. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, and removing items from the cart. It also exposes APIs for retrieving cart details and calculating cart totals.

**Recommendation Service:** This microservice is responsible for providing product recommendations to customers based on their browsing and purchase history. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior and suggest products that are likely to be of interest.

**Shipping Service:** This microservice is responsible for managing the shipping of products to customers. It provides functionalities for calculating shipping rates, generating shipping labels, and tracking packages.

**Inventory Service:** This microservice is responsible for managing the inventory of products in the ecommerce store. It provides functionalities for tracking product quantities, managing stock levels, and generating alerts for low inventory.

**Notification Service:** This microservice is responsible for sending notifications for users, sellers about various events like order posting, discounts, order tracking, returns etc.

*Each of these microservices can be developed and deployed independently, using their own database and API. They can communicate with each other using RESTful APIs or message queues. This architecture provides scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance, making it suitable for large-scale ecommerce applications.*
