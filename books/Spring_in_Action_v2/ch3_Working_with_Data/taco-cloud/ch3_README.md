## Chapter 3: Working with Data
### Defining a Schema and Preloading Data
Aside from the Ingredient table, we're also going to need some tables that hold 
order and design information.
    
    Taco_Order: Holds essential order details. 
    Taco: Holds essential information about a taco design. 
    Ingredient_Ref: Contains one or more rows for each row in Taco, mapping the taco to 
                    the ingredients for that taco. 
    Ingredient: Holds ingredient information.
